# Budgeted Maximum Coverage

This repository hosts the code of the project for the practical part of the exam of "Languages for Global Computing",
taught by Professor Baldan at the University of Padova.

In this project, we study the Budgeted Maximum Coverage (BMC) problem, and we propose a parallel algorithm for it.

- [python](./python) contains the Python 3.8 code to generate configurable instances for the BMC problem and export them to CSV files
- [rust](./rust) contains the Rust 1.56 implementation of serial and parallel implementations of BMC
- [scala](./scala) contains the Scala 2.11 implementation of serial and parallel implementations of BMC
